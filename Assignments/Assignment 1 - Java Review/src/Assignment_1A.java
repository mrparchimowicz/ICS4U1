 * ==========ASSIGNMENT 1==========
 * 
 * Write a java program that does the following:
 *     Declare and initialize 3 variables: a string called myName, a decimal value called quotient, and an 
 *       integer value called myNumber
 *     Prompt the user to enter their name (save as myName)
 *     Referring to the user by name, ask them for their number (get this value into the myNumber variable)
 *     Using appropriate formatting, tabs, spacing, etc. find the quotient of their number when divided by 
 *       each number from 1 to 10. 
 *     Output this to the console (sample output on the Assignment Sheet in the Drop Box)
 *     Comment appropriately (communication marks!)
 *    
 * EXTENSIONS:
 * 1)    Was your program written efficiently? Why or why not? If it wasn’t efficient, can you modify it to 
 *         use fewer lines of code for the calculations?
 * 2)    Why are the outputs in the sample printout all rounded off? 
 *        How do the different data types affect the accuracy of the answers? Research or 
 *        test out changes that would get more accurate quotients. Can you round your answers to two decimal places?
