 * NOTE: A "Sentinel" value is a value that is not normally a possible value that provides a condition under which the While loop can 
 * terminate. For instance, you could use while(studentMark != -1) as students are not expected to get a mark of -1.

 * ==========ASSIGNMENT 3==========
 * 
 * Write a java program that does the following:
 *     Write a program that offers a user 3 options:
 *         1)    To have the computer tell it a knock-knock joke
 *         2)    To have the computer find the highest value of 3 integer numbers
 *         3)    To have the computer calculate the roots of a quadratic given a, b and c.
 *     You must include the 3 types of methods in your program. 
 *     You must (at least sometimes) prompt the user for values outside of the methods so you can 
 *       practice passing values as parameters
 *     Create a loop so the user can continually choose one of these 3 options until they respond with a 
 *       sentinel value
