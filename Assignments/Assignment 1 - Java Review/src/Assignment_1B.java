 * ==========ASSIGNMENT 2==========
 * 
 * Write a java program that does the following:
 *     Write a program to add up a student’s test marks and find an average.
 *     The user should be prompted as to whether they know how many tests there will be in the semester.
 *     If they do know the number of tests, use an appropriate loop structure to add up their 
 *       test marks and calculate the average of the tests.
 *     If they do not know the number of tests in a semester, use an appropriate loop structure to add 
 *       up the test marks until a sentinel is reached, and then output the average of the tests entered.
 *     If they respond with an invalid choice, give an error message.
 *    
 * EXTENSIONS:
 * 1)    Was your program written efficiently? Why or why not? If it wasn’t efficient, can you modify it to use fewer lines of code? 
 * 2)    Did you have any errors in your calculations? If so, what happened? Can you troubleshoot them and correct?
